Space Engineers Workbench
=================================
SE Workbench is a development environment designed to help facilitate the creation and organization of in-game scripts, out of game. The focus of this project is to provide most of the tools one would expect from a development platform without the hassle of configuring Visual Studio. The goal is to overcome technical hurdles and make scripting in Space Engineers something anyone can begin learning to do, regardless of their background or experience.

Features
=================================
These are just a few of the features that have been implemented so far. This project is still in an alpha phase and certain precautions should be taken. I recommend backing up blueprints and scripts until SE workbench can do so on its own. the environment is pretty stable so far, but accidents do happen in alpha.

 * Syntax Highlighting, Auto-Completion, and Refactoring
 * An out-of-game script checker that tests scripts based on the actual parameters and limitations set forth by the game
 * Blueprint program importing and editing
 * Script Organization Based on Project -> Blueprint (Grid)

Caveats
=================================
SE Workbench does currently require that Space Engineers is installed on the host machine.
